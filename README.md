# happy-birthday.wav

This project is a simple C program that generates the Happy Birthday song as a .wav audio file.
The program synthesizes the melody by generating audio samples programmatically, without relying on external audio files.

It is mainly intended for educational purposes, demonstrating basic concepts such as:

- Audio signal generation
- WAV file structure
- File I/O in C
- Basic sound synthesis using frequencies and durations
